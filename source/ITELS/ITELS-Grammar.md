## **第一部分 如何表达一件事？ 第一讲 简单句的核心构成**

### 【课前思考】如下两句结构是否一样？

-  I find Hong Kong beautiful.
- These two unique aspects, one political, the other natural, make food production highly vulnerable and different from any other business. (剑 12, Test 6, READING PASSAGE 1, The risks agriculture faces in developing countries)

### 【课堂讲解】

  简单句最核心的成分是什么？ **主语+谓语**

  由于**谓语动词**的不同，简单句可以再细分成五类：主谓、主谓宾、主谓双宾、主谓宾补、主系表

1. 主谓 不及物动词（有实义）People live.
2. 主谓宾 Now everyone uses them. ( 剑 6, Test 1, READING PASSAGE 1, AUSTRALIA'S SPORTING SUCCESS)
3. 主谓双宾

   - I bought you a present. => I bought a present for you. 表目的用 for 

   -  They offered me a vacant post. => They offered a vacant post to me. 表方向用 to
4. 主谓宾补 I find Hong Kong beautiful(宾语补足语). 双宾结构通常是人+物。而宾补可以在宾语和补语中间加一个“是”，如果能够成完整句子，就是宾补结构
5. 主系表 I am very happy.  单独出现无实意 be 动词就是主系表结构

### 补充：常用的 4 类系动词

- be 动词   (单独出现才是系动词，如果和其他动词一起出现，则是助动词)
- get  become  turn  go  grow   表示“变得”含义才是系动词
- 感官动词  look  sound  smell  taste  feel   “（看／听／闻／尝／感觉）起来.... ”
  - you look beautiful
- keep  remain  /  seem  appear … 



 从简单句的核心变化为真题例句：

1. …over half the people in the world now live in cities.  => 主谓 people live 

2. These two unique aspects(方面，特色；朝向), one political, the other natural, make food production highly vulnerable and different from any other business.  => 主谓宾补 aspects make food production vulnerable and different

### 【课后练习】请判断简单句的种类。

1. Many primary school children find writing difficult… => children find writing difficult 主谓宾补
2.  Odours are also essential cues in social bonding.  => odours are essential 主系表
3. Inside the academies, science takes centre stage.  => 主谓宾
4. Three possible options have emerged.  => 主谓
5. … rainforests provide human habitats… => 主谓双宾

# 第二讲 简单句的核心变化 —— 谓语动词的时态/情态/语态

**（一）谓语动词的时态**

### 【课前思考】时态影响理解句子吗？

1. … stepwells were fundamental to life in the driest parts of India. 
2. … stepwells are fundamental...
3. … stepwells will be fundamental... 

### 【课堂讲解】
